# Braintenber Vehicles

Vehicles as if the they were animals in the natural environment.  

##### Fear and Aggresion

*Vehicle 2*
- (**Fear**) each sensor to the motor on the same side. More time in places where there is less "stuff" (light) that excites him and speed up when there  is exposed to higher concentrations. If the light is directly ahead. might hit the source unless it is deflected from it's course.If the source is on one side, one of the sensors, the one nearer to the source is more excited than the other, thus one motor works harder and the vehicle will turn away from the source. 
- **(Aggresive)** each sensor to the opposite side motor. No change if the source is ahead. Turn toward the source and eventually hit it.

*Vehicle 3 Love*

- switching the sign of influence of the stimilu from positive to negative. Motor slows down when corrensponding sensor activated. Both stop racing in the presence of the stimuli and race where the stimulus is weak.
- (a **Likes** ) orients towards the source. (b - crossed connections **Explorer** ) would drift slightly from the source and might speed up away from in since the source's inhibitory influence.
- **Values & Knowledge** implies a flow of information from the environment into a living being.

*Vehicle 4 Values*

- nonmonotonic connections of sensors and motors.
- "heuristic function" for various maximum intensity.
- **variety of behaviors**
- governed by various INSTINCTS
- Added variety of intensities of sensory stimulation for which the motor is/is not activated (no activation up to a threshold and activaion beyond the threshold). DECESITIONS are made.

*Vehicle 5 Logic*

- **threashold devices** between sensors and motors.
- threashold devices are connected to each other in various patterns.

*Vehicle 6 Selection*

- **Darwinian evolution**
